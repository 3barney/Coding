# LC389. Find the Difference

### LeetCode

## Question

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

**Example:**

```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
```

## Solutions

### Solution 1

* Java
```
public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
    int[] count = new int[128];
    for(char c : s.toCharArray())
        count[c]++;
    for(char tc : t.toCharArray())
        if(--count[tc]<0) return tc;
    return t.charAt(0);
}
```

1. Count the letters in `s` first.
2. Reduce the count based on the letters in `t`.
3. The negative count letter is the added letter.

**Complexity:**

* **worst-case time complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `t`.
* **worst-case space complexity:** `O(1)`.

### Solution 2

* C++
```
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    int n = t.length();
    for(int i=0; i<n-1; ++i)
        t[n-1] ^= s[i] ^ t[i];
    return t[n-1];
}
```

* C++
```
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    int res = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<s.length(); ++i)
        res ^= s[i] ^ t[i];
    return res ^ t[t.length()-1];
}
```

If we put the characters of both `s` and `t` together, the question becomes find the sigle char in a char group whose every element appears twice except for one. It's like the question <a href="LC136SingleNumber.md">LC136. Single Number</a>. We can use the same method to solve it.

**Complexity:**

* **worst-case time complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `t`.
* **worst-case space complexity:** `O(1)`.
