# Army Game

## Question
Luke is daydreaming in Math class. He has a sheet of graph paper with n rows and m columns, and he imagines that there is an army base in each cell for a total of n Â· m bases. He wants to drop supplies at strategic points on the sheet, marking each drop point with a red dot. If a base contains at least one package inside or on top of its border fence, then it's considered to be supplied. For example:

![Army Game 1](Images/ArmyGame1.png)

Given n and m, what's the minimum number of packages that Luke must drop to supply all of his bases?

**Input Format**

Two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n and m.

**Constraints**

* 0 < n,m <= 1000

**Output Format**

Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of supply packages Luke must drop.

**Sample Input 0**

2 2

**Sample Output 0**

1

**Explanation 0**

Luke has four bases in a 2 X 2 grid. If he drops a single package where the walls of all four bases intersect, then those four cells can access the package:

![Army Game 1](Images/ArmyGame1.png)

Because he managed to supply all four bases with a single supply drop, we print 1 as our answer.

## Solution
Java1
```bash
public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = in.nextInt();
        int m = in.nextInt();
        System.out.println( ((m+1)/2) * ((n+1)/2) );
    }
```
