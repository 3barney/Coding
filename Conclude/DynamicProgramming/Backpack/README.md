## Finite & Infinite

There are two type of Backpack question

1. The number of each element in the Backpack is **limisted**. In this case, we need at lease 2D `DP`, one of index is to indicate the number of elements in the Backpack.
2. The number of each element in the Backpack is **infinite**. In this case, we don't need to indicate how many elements we used to reach our target. So `1D` `DP` could work.
